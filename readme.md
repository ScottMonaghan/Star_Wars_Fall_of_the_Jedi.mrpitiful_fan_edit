# Star Wars: Fall of the Jedi -  Mr Pitiful's Open Source Fan Edit of Episodes I - III

This is one Star Wars fan's passion project, taking the mess of Episodes I-III 
and editing them into a single, cohesive, and hopefully decent film.

It is also an attempt to show this can be done legally and through open source.
This repo includes only the Adobe Premiere project files and reference stills.

To watch the movie, legally owned copies of the source films will need to be 
added to the project, and then the film can be rendered.  

How do you do that?  Instructions below!

##But first, watch a clip!
Here Yoda and Palpatine battle, uninterrupted, without constantly cutting away from the action, as it was edited in the original Revenge of the Sith.

##Summary of Edits
### 1.0.3
**Updated Ending**
* Props to http://reddit.com/u/noodle-finger for inspiration
* Removed excess dialogue and reactions surrounding padme’s delivery
and death
* Split Padme’s delivery and transformation into Vader into two
separate sequences
* Removed Padme naming Leia as to not serve as spoiler for ROTJ when
watching in machete order
* Added rhythmic fadeouts to simulate  Vader’s coming in and out of
consciousness during his surgery
* Cut directly from Padme’s death to Vader’s rise
* Removed Vader’s zombie walk and NOooOOOOooOOoOO
* Removed “what do we do with the kids and where do we go now”
conversation between Yoda, Obi Wan and Organa
* Cut right to “Directed by George Lucas” following Vader, Palpatine,
and Tarkin looking over the construction of the Death Star
* Updated the initial (non-scrolling) credits to include credits from
all 3 movies without split screen.
* Add Mr. Pitiful:) to the credits as one of the editors
* Moved hopeful delivery of Leia and Luke to mid-credits scene
  * (an attempt at a humorous take on the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s
habit of post-credit scenes teasing future films)

### 1.0.0
**Initial Release!**
* Wanted to focus on the Anakin's arc plus the arc of the fall of the Republic in the background. Anything that didn't move the story forward I cut, while trying to have it make sense for anyone who has never seen Star Wars.
* Cut all of Phantom Menace except the Darth Maul fight as a prologue.
* Started right from the 2nd assassination of padme to establish Anakin, Obi Wan, and Padme's characters
* Cut all of Kamino (Obi Wan explains through exposition)
* Cut all references to Padme and Anakin's age difference
* Kept a bare minimum of Anakin / Padme on Naboo to establish that they are into each other
* Cut all of Anakin & Padme's trip to Tatooine and his mother
* Cut all R2 D2 / C3PO slapstick
* Cut all Jar Jar
* Simplified Geonosis
  * Cut factory battle
  * Cut monsters from arena
  * Lowered the cheese level on Padme's love declaration.
* Cut opening battle from III (Obi Wan delivers it through exposition)
* Reordered scenes to clarify the fear of losing Padme as Anakin's primary motivation with Palpatine offering his only out and the Jedi not treating him well.
* Cut all of the Obi Wan / General Grevious to focus on Anakin just hearing about it, and becoming more resentful he is left out.
* Separated Yoda/Palpatine from Obi Wan/Anakin to allow the Y/P to serve as warmup for the OW/A main event
* Removed evidence that Obi Wan was on Padme's ship to Mustafar so we don't see Obi Wan until Padme does, our hopes crushed with hers:)
* Plus a whole bunch of other small things to make it all work.

## TLDR; of How to Render and Watch
* Download the [Adobe Premiere project](https://github.com/ScottMonaghan/Star_Wars_Fall_of_the_Jedi.mrpitiful_fan_edit/archive/master.zip).
* Replace the offline source footage with legally obtained footage of Episodes I-III 
* Align the footage in the Alignment Sequences with the included reference frames
* Render and enjoy!

### I: Remove DRM from the iTunes Source Files 

In order to import your source files into Premiere, you will need to make sure DRM is removed.  If you already have legal DRM-free digital copies of Episodes I-III you can skip this step.  This tutorial only covers removing DRM from movies downloaded from the iTunes store.  If you own legal copies in a different format, (e.g. Blu-Ray), contact me at scott.monaghan@gmail.com and I'll give you a hand.  Also, if you happen to be successful doing this yourself and want to update this tutorial with instructions, feel free to update and send me a pull request.

#### Convert Your Files with Noteburner M4V Converter Plus
![Noteburner Example](http://imgur.com/8Hl1AKg.png)

1. Be sure you've downloaded all 3 movies on your local copy of iTunes
2. Open Noteburner M4V Plus
3. Choose the Episode I-III
...It should look like the screenshot above
4. Press Convert
**NOTE: This will take A WHILE. You might want to leave this running over night**
**When finished, spot check your videos to be sure to check that the audio and video properly converted.**


### II: Unzip the Master.zip!
  ![Expected File Structure After Unzip](http://imgur.com/z3anl6x.png)
* The unzipped file structure should look similar to above.
* Don't worry if the hidden files are missing (.DS_Store, .git, .gitignore)


### III: Copy the Converted Source Files into a "source" Folder Wherever you Unzipped Master.zip
  ![Expected File Structure with Source Files](http://imgur.com/cjBIHrN.png)
* After copying the source the file structure should look like above
* Again, don't worry if the hidden files are missing (.DS_Store, .git, .gitignore)
 

### IV: Import the Source Files
1. Open Star_Wars_Fall_of_the_Jedi.mrpitiful_fan_edit.prproj in Adobe Premiere
2. In the project window, expand the Source > Raw Footage Folder.
3. The 3 clips should have question marks as shown below:
  ![Raw Footage Folder in Premiere](http://imgur.com/GBQvBL8.png)
4. Right-Click (Windows) or Control-Click (Mac) on Star Wars_ Attack of the Clones.mp4 and choose "Replace Footage..."
  ![Replace Footage...](http://imgur.com/nEWbm6O.png)
5. Find select Star Wars_Attack of the Clones.mp4 on disk.
  ![Select mp4 file](http://imgur.com/HFvENMD.png)
6. After selecting the clip in the Premiere Project pane should have changed from a question mark to an audio/video icon:
  ![Audio/Video Icon](http://imgur.com/QooSGn2.png)
7. Repeat steps 4-6 for Phantom Menace and Revenge of the Sith


### V: Align the Source Sequences

If you've used the iTunes versions of these movies, chances are, everything is now aligned properly, but it's a good idea to check, and if you are using another footage source, this step is crucial.

To get this whole thing to work, I have a single reference frame in video track 3 of Alignment Sequences of the exact point when the Star Wars logo first appears.  As long as you align the clip in video track 2 to match the reference frame perfectly, the edits for the whole movie should be correct.

####Here's what we need to do:
1. Expand the "Episode I" folder under the "Source" folder in the Project window.
2. Double Click on "Episode I Alignment Sequence"
  ![Alignment Sequence in Project Window](http://imgur.com/lw4Wuo3.png)
3. In the Sequence pane target the V3 track
  * Click on the V3 and make sure it is dark blue as shown below:
  * ![Target V3](http://imgur.com/DaiH7Ss.png)
4. Be sure the Sequence pane is selected and press the down arrow key until the blue scrubber is lined up exactly at the beginning of the clip in V3 as so:
  ![Align Scrubber](http://imgur.com/mwqLYOT.png)
5. Click the eye icon to toggle the visibility on and off on V3 while watching the Preview pane.
  * You should see no change or jump in the preview window.
  * If you do, slide the V2 clip left/right until it lines up perfectly to the frame.
  * The preview window should look like this:
  * ![Properly Aligned Preview Window](http://imgur.com/HAcXSe4.png)
6. **IMPORTANT: make sure to toggle OFF visibility of V3 when done** 
  otherwise you might end up rendering the reference frame in the final cut.
7. Repeat steps 1-6 for Episode II and Episode III



### VI: Export the Main Draft!
1. Find the "Main Draft" sequence in the Project pane.
2. Right-Click (Windows) or Control-Click (Mac) on the "Main Draft" sequence.
3. Choose "Export Media..."
  ![Export Main Draft](http://imgur.com/PJxVW2U.png)
4. Export to your favorite format
