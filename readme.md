# Star Wars: Fall of the Jedi -  Mr Pitiful's Open Source Fan Edit of Episodes I - III

This is one Star Wars fan's passion project of taking the mess of Episodes I-III 
and editing them into a single, cohesive, and hopefully dececent film.

It is also an attempt to show this can be done legally and through open source.
This repo includes only the Adobe Premeire project files and reference stills.

To watch the movie, legally owned copies of the source films will need to be 
added to the project, and then the film can be rendered.  

How do you do that?  Instructions below!

## How to Render and Watch!?

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to watch this film.

### Step 1: Remove DRM from the iTunes Source Files 

In order to import your source files into Premeire, you will need to make sure DRM is removed.  If you already have legal DRM-free digital copies of Episodes I-III you can skip this step.  This tutorial only covers removing DRM from movies downloaded from the iTunes store.  If you own legal copies in a different format, (e.g. Blu-Ray), contact me at scott.monaghan@gmail.com and I'll give you a hand.  Also, if you happen to be successful doing this yourself and want to update this tutorial with instructions, feel free to update and send me a pull request.
