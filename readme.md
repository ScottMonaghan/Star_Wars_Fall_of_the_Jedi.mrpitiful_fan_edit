# Star Wars: Fall of the Jedi -  Mr Pitiful's Open Source Fan Edit of Episodes I - III

This is one Star Wars fan's passion project of taking the mess of Episodes I-III 
and editing them into a single, cohesive, and hopefully dececent film.

It is also an attempt to show this can be done legally and through open source.
This repo includes only the Adobe Premeire project files and reference stills.

To watch the movie, legally owned copies of the source films will need to be 
added to the project, and then the film can be rendered.  

How do you do that?  Instructions below!
